I am a student with a profound curiosity on how the technologies around me function.

## Objective
To leverage my skills and talent as someone of the Cyber World to protect those around me.

My journey of discovery into how computers work has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to work in this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
